title: Token Blockchains
---

We have built prototypes of MPX and MPXR on the Ethereum blockchain, but the speed and gas cost right now make it hard to use them in everyday life. Our current strategy is to distribute the tokens in two stages:

- First, make MPX and MPXR as Ethereum-based assets and divide the transactions into two: off-chain and on-chain. The on-chain transaction will be executed periodically in order to reduce the gas cost.
- Second, release MPXR on top of the Cardano blockchain once multi-asset Cardano support is ready and increase the frequency of the on-chain transactions.
