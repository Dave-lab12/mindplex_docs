title: Compensating Creators
---

MPX tokens are given to content creators who create high-performing content. The performance ranges for a piece of content are shown in the table below. In the alpha version, Mindplex will use the ranges and rewards listed below. In the beta version, the amount will be changed based on how the Mindplex community votes.

The award amounts listed in the table below are the results of our simulation. In this test, one MPX token was worth $0.15 USD. The more the MPX token's value grows, the more compensation content creators receive.

The MPXR value of a piece of content is the total value of all interactions with that content, calculated as follows: all reputation tokens (MPXR) awarded to the content creator minus all negative reputation tokens (MPXR) awarded to the content creator plus all reputation tokens (MPXR) awarded to users who interacted with that content.
