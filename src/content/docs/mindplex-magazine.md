description: What is Mindplex Magazine.
---

Mindplex Magazine is a Futurist and Singularitarian publication that investigates breaking science and technology news and ideas that are ushering in radically new futures. Text, video, spatial audio, comics, virtual reality (VR), technological demonstrations, and anything else that may come up will be included in the magazine. This content will be created by professionals, guests, and the SingularityNET community, with collaborative content and contests to identify the best user-created content (with MPX tokens as a reward).

### Among the Singularitarian themes to be explored are:

- **Artificial Intelligence** — the push for Artificial General Intelligence, out-of-the-mainstream applications of AI, AI ethics, and AI aesthetics & art.
- **Biotech** — genetic engineering, engineered lifeforms, and biohacking.
- **Blockchain** — and its potential to create decentralized networks, upending the economy, identity, and ownership
- **Body enhancement** — from the funky and freaky to the profound, including brain and body implants with real computational power
- **Brain-computer Interfacing** — for instant brain-to-computer-cloud communications, connecting to the global brain
- **Neuroscience** — combined with AI and speculative directions like quantum neuroscience.
- **Consciousness** — neurofeedback, psychedelics, and other tech for consciousness expansion
- **Decentralization** — of the web, the internet, the power grid, sovereign data, ultimately leading to a fairer society
- **Experiences** — VR/AR/MR/Metaverses/spatial sound/liminal/new realities/The Matrix
- **Health and Longevity** — anything and everything helping humanity toward radically longer lifespans and healthspans
- **Military and surveillance tech** — which is advancing fast, focusing on ethical and privacy issues
- **Nanotech** — including molecular machines, and beyond to femtotech
- **Quantum Computing** — including quantum machine learning and quantum cryptography
- **Parapsychology** — scientific data and exploratory theories about strange phenomena going beyond conventional science
- **Radical physics** theories, yielding insights into the nature of the universe and perhaps new technologies
- **Space** — steps to becoming a spacefaring civilization
- **Community Discussion** — Book, film, TV, new tech products, reviews, new ideas
- **Advanced tech for the developing world** — how the global poor can leapfrog into the future, and the social implications if they don't.
- **Ethics** — of Privacy and Data Protection, Algorithmic Bias and Discrimination, Cyber security and Hacking, Digital Divide and Accessibility
  Moral and Religious questions of creating a conscious machine to slave for humanity, Social Impact and Technological Determinism
- **Absurd** — presents outlandish, unconventional, and imaginative ideas and or satirical pieces mocking some of our tech gadget and notions
