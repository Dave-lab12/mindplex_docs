title: Guiding Site Moderation with MPXR
---

Members of the Mindplex community who have a large MPXR token balance can also participate in moderating posts and comments. There are different levels of moderation, and increasing levels of MPXR allow you to moderate at higher levels of power:

- Level 1 Moderation: Right to moderate but can be corrected by level 2 moderators.
- Level 2 Moderators: right to moderate, can correct level 1 moderators, and can be corrected by higher level moderators.
- Level 3 Moderators: right to moderate, can correct level 1 and 2 moderators, and can be corrected by higher level moderators. Can submit appeals to be voted on by all moderators.
- Level 4 Moderators: right to moderate, can correct level 1, 2 and 3 moderators, can submit appeals to be voted on by all moderators, and are invited to join in on regular meetings with the team for platform strategy discussions.
- Admin Moderators: roles reserved for official employees of the team.

The requirements for becoming a Moderator will be proposed and determined by the Mindplex community through an open voting process. Once a community member has met the requirements to become a moderator, their role will be approved by a vote.
