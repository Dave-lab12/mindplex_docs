title: â€‹Legal Issues around Content

Mindplex will make sure that all requests for and submissions of content are in line with the Mindplex Network's constitution. The community members will vote on the final draft of the constitution, which will be proposed by the governing bodies that will be talked about in later sections.

Mindplex supports free speech, the press, and the right to express oneself. However, we will not allow illegal content, hate speech, plagiarism, slander, or attacks on people. The Mindplex constitution will elaborate on this prohibited and frowned-upon behavior.

As a result, each content request that passes through the content factory will be subjected to the editorial team's rational scrutiny at first. If we receive notices from judicial and/or law enforcement agencies regarding any submitted content, we will follow the provisions of the notice without prior notice to the content creator.
