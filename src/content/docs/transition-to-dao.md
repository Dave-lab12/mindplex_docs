title: Transition to DAO
---

Mindplex Media Management will make the majority of governance decisions in the early stages. As the network matures, decision-making will shift in stages to purely democratic governance, with the following specifics:

**Phase 1** (following the initial token generation event)

- major changes are to be determined by Mindplex Media Management
- minor changes will be determined by a 51% majority of MPX token holders.

**Phase 2** (after the beta version is live)

- major changes in Mindplex operations: agreement of the Mindplex Media Management plus a 51% majority of MPX token holder votes
- Minor changes in Mindplex operations: a 51% majority of MPX token votes

**Phase 3** (after version 2.0)

- Major changes in Mindplex operations: a 65% supermajority of MPX token votes
- minor changes in Mindplex operations: a 51% majority of MPX token votes

**Phase 4** **and onwards**, full DAO

Major and minor changes in Mindplex operation: a 51% majority of MPX token votes
