description: What is Mindplex Magazine.
---

Mindplex will showcase new AI technologies and their applications to various types of content. Mindplex is incubated by SingularityNET, and Mindplex can be thought of as a project to apply artificial intelligence to the mediasphere in the same way that SingularityNET's other spin-offs do. After a period of improvement, each piece of AI-media tech that Mindplex puts out can be licensed by other media sites.

Some of these services are:

1. Reputation and rating of media, media creators and raters. Mindplex has a merit-based reputation framework which uses AI to prevent reputation fraud and abuse of the system.
2. Content Factory – where consumers request content from creators, and these requests are shared, voted on, and backed.
3. Smart newsfeed customization, based on a reader's history, using AI to give people things that will interest them, avoiding “filter bubbles” that focus their reading too narrowly, based on their past history or their social network.
4. Automatic summary generation of news stories or other content
5. Virtual character technology for use as virtual influencers, virtual celebrities, personalized advisors, etc.

### Progressive updating

At the time of launch, all of these AI features will be showcased on the Mindplex site in limited, but still powerful, forms, and will then be gradually upgraded to more and more sophisticated versions. When the Mindplex site goes live, it will have a basic version of the Content Factory, which includes AI that makes images and creates personalized news feeds automatically.

Mindplex's mature version will include a few AI-guided virtual characters who comment on articles and respond to comments made by human readers or each other. These virtual characters will be a fun and distinct part of the site's social community, learning as they go and refining their responses based on experience — not in a shallow, imitative way, but by building a model of the conversation's context. They will learn about you as you interact with them on the platform, remembering specifics about your personality.

The Mindplex AI comment-bots will be far more advanced than Microsoft Tay and other online chatbots, but they will still be a long way from future human-level AGIs. And, as AI advances, they will be constantly upgraded thanks to Mindplex's partnership with the SingularityNET Foundation, its world-class AI R&D team, and its global, decentralized AI community.
